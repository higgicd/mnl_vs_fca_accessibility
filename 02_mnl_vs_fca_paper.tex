\begin{abstract}
Floating Catchment Area (FCA) methods are a popular choice for modelling
accessibility to healthcare services because of their ability to
consider both supply and demand. However, FCA methods do not fully
consider aspects of travel and choicemaking behaviour as the only
behavioural component is the impedance function. FCA approaches also
tend to assign population demand to clinics and levels-of-service to
population zones in an overlapping manner that has been shown to bias
results by inflating/deflating supply and demand. While the adjustments
proposed in the recent ``Balanced FCA'' method can rectify this, it
apportions population and levels of service in a fractional manner. In
response, this research proposes a utility-based measure of healthcare
accessibility based on a multinomial logit (MNL) destination choice
model that avoids the multiple-counting issue in FCA methods and
considers several additional behavioural aspects that define the appeal
of clinics in addition to the travel time required to reach them,
including their capacity and level of crowding. Comparisons of the MNL
approach with the original and balanced FCA models using data for the
City of Hamilton, Canada, suggests that while the accessibility patterns
produced by each method are broadly similar, some key differences exist
in the calculated accessibilities and their spatial patterns. The MNL
model in particular estimates higher accessibilities in suburban and
rural areas. Based on these findings, we argue that both the Balanced
FCA and MNL approaches offer merit for planning and policy.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}}

The COVID-19 global pandemic has emphasized the importance of healthcare
accessibility, particularly access to primary care physicians, who
provide the first point of contact between patients and the healthcare
system. In Canada, the Canada Health Act states that all residents
should have ``reasonable access'' to healthcare. However, the 2017
Canadian Community Health Survey revealed that 15.3\% of Canadians aged
12 or over did not have a primary care physician, of whom 17.2\% stated
that there is no physician accessible within their area (1).

Accessibility to healthcare services is defined by both spatial and
aspatial components (2). Aspatial factors include the cost and quality
of healthcare services and the socioeconomic, demographic, and mobility
profile of potential users (2). The second component considers
geographic accessibility, which can be defined as the potential to
interact with a given set of opportunities, such as healthcare
facilities or primary care physicians, from a given location using the
transportation network (3). Accessibility to healthcare can therefore be
improved through either an increase in the number of available
opportunities or through improvements to the transportation network.

In general, four approaches for calculating accessibility exist:
infrastructure-based approaches, which focus on the capacity of
transportation infrastructure; location-based approaches, which focus on
spatial distributions of opportunities; person-based approaches, which
focus on accessibility on an individual level; and utility-based
measures, which focus on the utility derived from interacting with the
opportunity or participating in an activity (4). Of these, place-based
measures are the most common in the literature and, of these, the family
of ``floating catchment area'' (FCA) methods is one of the most popular
approaches for calculating place-based healthcare accessibility. Because
healthcare access is sensitive to demand and supply, Luo and Wang (5)
(drawing on Radke and Mu (6)) introduced the Two-step Floating Catchment
Area (2SFCA) method that first estimates the demand for healthcare at
service locations from population zones and then allocates the level of
service back to the population zones using a binary measure of travel
impedance.

Since then, various improvements have been made to the 2SFCA approach to
better capture the friction of distance. The original 2SFCA has been
criticized for over-estimating demand and under-estimating levels of
service in the estimation of accessibilities due to the
multiple-counting of populations that arises from the overlapping
catchments in a study area. In response, researchers have proposed
solutions such as the Three-step Floating Catchment Area (3SFCA) (7),
Modified 2SFCA (M2SFCA) (8), and Balanced 2SFCA (B2SFCA) (9) methods. Of
these, the B2SFCA is the only approach that preserves the original
population and resulting levels of service in calculating floating
catchment accessibilities.

However, despite these innovations, FCA methods remain limited in
several ways. First, FCA approaches often inflate or deflate demand and
supply in the calculation of healthcare access. While the B2SFCA
remedies this, it does so by assigning fractions of populations to
clinics and service ratios to population zones. While the parameters of
the balanced method sum to the original zonal populations and
provider-to-population ratios, this fractional approach does not reflect
the ways in which individuals choose to visit facilities. Second, the
appeal of any given healthcare facility from the perspective of the
population is based solely on its distance or travel time from the
origin zone using the transportation network.

In response, this research utilizes a random utility-based formulation
for modelling accessibility to healthcare services. In contrast to FCA
approaches, each patient is, on average, assigned to a single clinic,
avoiding the issue of double-counting and inflation/deflation of the
demand and levels-of-service respectively in the 2SFCA methods and the
assignment of fractional individuals to clinics in the B2SFCA method.
Beyond travel time, this specification also allows the analyst to
include additional characteristics of the facilities that affect their
appeal, such as CONGESTION. To illustrate the potential of the MNL
approach, we compare it against the use of the 2SFCA and B2SFCA, both
using a continuous decay function.

\section{Methodology}\label{methodology}}

\hypertarget{floating-catchment-methods}{%
\subsection{Floating Catchment
Methods}\label{floating-catchment-methods}}

The 2-step floating catchment area (2SFCA) method, developed by Luo and
Wang, calculates accessibility to healthcare using catchment areas based
on a travel time threshold (5). The first step of this method is
calculating the physician-to-population ratio, \(R_j\), for each clinic
at location \(j\):

\[
R_j = \frac{S_j}{\sum_i{P_iW_{ij}}}
\]

Where \(S_j\) is the number of physicians at clinic \(j\) and \(P_i\) is
the population of zone \(i\) weighted by some function of the travel
time \(W_{ij}\) between zones \(i\) and \(j\). In the original 2SFCA,
Luo and Wang (5) utilize a binary impedance function:

\[
W_{ij} = f(t_{ij}) = \left\{
        \begin{array}{ll}
            1 & \quad t_{ij} \leq t_0 \\
            0 & \quad t_{ij} > t_0
        \end{array}
    \right.
\]

where the weight equals 1 for populations within the travel time
threshold \(t_0\) and zero beyond. In this case, Luo and Wang (5) set
\(t_0 = 15\) minutes. The second step calculates accessibility \(A_i\)
for the population centres as the sum of the physician-to-population
ratios \(R_j\) weighted by the impedance function:

\[
A_i = \sum_j{R_jW_{ij}}
\]

While the 2SFCA approach is a special case of a gravity-based
accessibility measure, the binary impedance function used by Luo and
Wang (5) does not consider the effects of competition and travel
impedance within a given catchment area. All clinics within a population
centre's catchment area are considered equally accessible, regardless of
distance, size, wait times, or any other measures of attractiveness.
Moreover, all clinics outside of a population centre's catchment area
are considered completely inaccessible. To remedy this, Luo and Qi (10)
propose the Enhanced 2-step Floating Catchment Area (E2SFCA) method that
introduces categorical weights for different travel time thresholds to
account for travel impedance. Others have improved on the 2SFCA and
E2SFCA by using variable catchment sizes (11), continuous travel time
decay functions (12), and adaptive approaches (13) to better reflect
travel time costs and the greater appeal of more proximate
opportunities.

Researchers have also sought to improve the ways in which supply and
demand are modeled in floating catchment approaches. Previous research
has shown that both demand and supply can be inflated/deflated in FCA
methods (7--9). This is a consequence of the overlapping floating
catchments that cause the populations in zones \(i\) to be counted
multiple times in the calculation of the provider-to-population ratio
\(R_j\). These levels-of-service are, in turn, counted multiple times
when allocated back to the population zones in the calculation of
\(A_i\). In response, Wan et al.~propose the use of additional Gaussian
weights to modify the binary impedance function used by Luo and Wang
(5). Delamater's (8) M2SFCA modifies the second step of the 2SFCA
approach by squaring the impedance function to increase the rate of
decay on the level of service. This is done to reflect the increased
friction population centres may experience when accessing healthcare
facilities in sub-optimally configured urban systems.

However, neither of these approaches fully resolves the issue of demand
and supply inflation/deflation. To that end, the B2SFCA approach from
Páez et al. (9) replaces the impedance functions with row-standardized
weights \(W_{ij}^{i}\) in the first step:

\[
R_j = \frac{S_j}{\sum_i{P_iW_{ij}^{i}}}
\] \[
W_{ij}^{i} = \frac{W_{ij}}{\sum_j W_{ij}}
\]

and with column-standardized weights \(W_{ij}^{j}\) in the second step:

\[
A_i = \sum_j{R_jW_{ij}^{j}}
\] \[
W_{ij}^{j} = \frac{W_{ij}}{\sum_i W_{ij}}
\]

In this formulation, the travel-time weighted populations sum to the
original population values and do not deflate the level-of-service at
the clinics. By extension, the levels of service available at the
population centres are not inflated through multiple counting.
Nevertheless, despite offering balance across both stages of the FCA
approach, the B2SFCA also results in fractional apportionment of the
population and levels-of-service between the population zones and
clinics.

For this research, we employ both the 2SFCA and B2SFCA approaches with a
negative exponential impedance function:

\[
W_{ij} = e^{-\beta t_{ij}}
\]

where \(\beta\) is a parameter that determines the decay of the function
and \(t_{ij}\) is the travel time between clinic \(j\) and population
centre \(i\). The \(\beta\) parameter is set to 0.05 as this is in the
range of typical auto travel time parameters in logit mode choice models
calibrated in the Greater Toronto and Hamilton Area. Travel times are
calculated based on car travel using a street network from OpenStreetMap
and the \texttt{r5r} routing tool (14).

\hypertarget{utility-based-method}{%
\subsection{Utility-based Method}\label{utility-based-method}}

To address the limitations of existing methods, a novel methodology is
developed which assigns trips from population centres to clinics. The
general form of this function is as follows:

\[
T_{ij} = f(H_i, Z_j, R_j, t_{ij}, \beta)
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(T_{ij}\) is the number of trips from zone \(i\) to clinic \(j\)
\item
  \(H_i\) is the number of households in zone \(i\)
\item
  \(Z_j\) is the number of doctors at clinic \(j\)
\item
  \(R_j\) is the demand-to-capacity ratio at clinic \(j\) (note this is
  inverted from the physician-to-population ratios used in previous FCA
  approaches)
\item
  \(t_{ij}\) is the travel time between zones \(i\) and \(j\), and
  \(\beta\) is a row vector of parameters to be estimated.
\end{itemize}

To estimate these parameters, information minimization is used as this
approach allows for the least-biased parameter estimation and has been
proven to be identical to utility maximization (15). Based on
information minimization theory, the probability that a household in
zone i will visit clinic j can be estimated as follows:

\[
MAX_{T_{ij}} E = -\sum_{j \in J} \sum_{i \in I} T_{ij} log(T_{ij})
\]

Subject to the following constraints:

\[
\sum_{j \in J}T_{ij} = \alpha H_i \forall i \in I 
\] \[
\sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J} T_{ij} t_{ij} = \bar{t}T 
\] \[
\sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J} T_{ij} log(C_j) = \sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J}T_{ij} log \omega Z_j = \bar{C}T 
\] \[
\sum_{i \in I} \sum_{j \in J} T_{ij} R_j = \bar{R}T
\]

where:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  \(I\) is the set of all residential zones
\item
  \(J\) is the set of all clinics
\item
  \(\alpha\) is the average number of visits to the doctor per household
\item
  \(\bar{t}\) is the average observed travel time for home-based trips
  to clinics
\item
  \(T\) is the total number of daily trips to clinics
\item
  \(C_j\) is the nominal service capacity at clinic \(j\)
\item
  \(\omega\) is the average number of patients served by a doctor per
  day
\item
  \(\bar{C}\) is the average observed nominal service capacity
\item
  \(\bar{R}\) is the average observed demand-to-capacity ratio
\item
  \(H\) is the total number of households
\item
  \(Z\) is the total number of primary care physicians
\end{itemize}

The service capacities and demand-to-capacity ratios are calculated as
follows:

\[
C_j = \omega Z_j
\] \[
R_j = \frac{\sum_{i \in I} T_{ij}}{C_j} = \frac{\sum_{i \in I} T_{ij}}{\omega Z_j}
\]

Solving this set of equations yields the following:

\[
T_{ij} = \alpha H_i P_{ij}
\]

This is a singly-constrained gravity model where the probability that a
household in zone \(i\) will visit clinic \(j\) is as follows:

\[
P_{ij} = \frac{e^{\beta_1 t_{ij} + \beta_{K+2} log \omega Z_j + \beta_{K + 3} R_j}}{\sum_j\prime e^{\beta_1 t_{ij}\prime + \beta_{K+2} log \omega Z_j\prime + \beta_{K + 3} R_j\prime}}
\]

Ideally, the \(\beta_1\), \(\beta_{K+2}\), and \(\beta_{K + 3}\)
parameters would be estimated iteratively in order to meet the outlined
constraints. However, due to a lack of observed data on trips to
doctors, these parameters are instead chosen based on the following
considerations:

\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The \(\beta_1\) travel time impedance parameter is set to -0.05 based
  on previous choice models in the region and to align with the 2SFCA
  and B2SFCA approaches above
\item
  Random utility theory requires \(\beta_{K+2}\) to lie between 0 to 1
  in value. It is set equal to 1 in this case to maximize the
  attractiveness of larger clinics.
\item
  No theory is currently available to guide the choice of the
  \(\beta_{K+3}\) parameter and so -0.5 is chosen as a ``first guess''
  at a parameter value that would produce a reasonable sensitivity to
  clinic over-crowding, but not prevent over-crowding from occurring
\end{itemize}

These values ensure that increased travel times and demand-to-capacity
ratios reduce the probability that a household in zone \(i\) will visit
clinic \(j\), and increased capacity at clinic \(j\) increases the
probability.

In order to ensure that \(\bar{R}\) is approximately equal to 1, the
\(\alpha\) and \(\omega\) parameters are assumed to be 0.065 visits to
the doctor per household and 22 patients seen by a doctor per day, on
average, respectively. Since \(R_j\) is a function of \(T_{ij}\) and
vice-versa, an iterative approach is taken to estimate the \(R_j\)
values. The multinomial logit destination choice model ensures that
demand at clinics is not over-estimated, as each patient on average is
assigned to a single clinic and is not double counted, as occurs in the
2SFCA method. The end result is an approach that involves location
choice modelling by maximizing utility for patients, with clinics with
higher demand and longer travel times attracting fewer trips while
larger clinics and those closer to the origins attract more trips.

\hypertarget{utility-based-accessibility}{%
\subsection{Utility-based
Accessibility}\label{utility-based-accessibility}}

As shown by Anas (15), multinomial logit models are equivalent to
gravity models. Following Ben-Akiva and Lerman (16), accessibility can
be defined within random utility theory as the expected maximum utility
for a trip. For the multinomial logit model, it can be shown that this
is the natural logarithm of the denominator of the logit model (the
so-called ``logsum'' or ``inclusive value'' term), yielding for this
model the following accessibility measure:

\[
a_i = log(\sum_{j\prime} e^{\beta_1 t_{ij}\prime + \beta_{K+2} log \omega Z_j\prime + \beta_{K + 3} R_j\prime})
\]

\hypertarget{study-area}{%
\section{Study Area}\label{study-area}}

The study area for this research is the City of Hamilton in Ontario,
Canada. Based on data from the 2016 Canadian Census of Population, the
population of Hamilton is 536,917 living in 211,596 households. Based on
the assumed \(\omega = 0.065\) visits to the doctor per household, this
results in 13,753.74 trips to the doctor entering the MNL model. The
left panel of Figure \ref{fig:study_area_map} plots population densities
in the Dissemination Areas, the smallest geographic unit in the census,
in the City of Hamilton, highlighting that the higher-density urban core
is surrounded by lower-density suburbs that extend into land that is
largely rural in character.

Information on the count and location of primary care physicians was
obtained using the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario's
online registration database. Clinic locations were geocoded based on
their address and records were aggregated to count the number of
physicians practicing at each unique location. The data for this paper
have been used previously by Páez et al. (9), although in this case we
consider only clinics that are within the spatial extent of the City of
Hamilton. While this does introduce edge effects in the calculation of
accessibility, limiting the study extent to a closed system permits
calculation of the multinomial logit model's congestion effects and
utility-based accessibilities. In total, there are 631 primary care
physicians available at clinics in the City of Hamilton in our data.
Note that this is not strictly the number of physicians, as some
physicians offer services at more than one clinic. Rather, it reflects
the availability of physicians at given locations. The right panel of
Figure \ref{fig:study_area_map} plots the location and total number of
available physicians at the clinic locations. This total produces a
city-wide average provider-to-population ratio of 117.52 primary care
doctors available per 100,000 people. Based on our assumption of
\(\alpha = 22\) patients seen per doctor every day, this results in a
total capacity of 13,882 patient visits per day in the MNL model
formulation.

\section{Results}\label{results}}

\hypertarget{demand-and-clinic-level-of-service}{%
\subsection{Demand and Clinic Level of
Service}\label{demand-and-clinic-level-of-service}}

To compare the three methods, we focus first on the results associated
with how each of the methods calculates demand and levels of service at
the clinic locations. The level of service for the FCA approaches is the
local provider-to-population ratio (PPR) for each clinic while the MNL
model calculates trip demand-to-patient capacity ratios (DCR). To make
this comparable, we first take the inverse of the MNL ratios to reflect
patient capacity-to-trip demand ratio (CDR). Figure \ref{fig:ppr_dist}
displays a pair plot of the density of each level-of-service statistic
and their relationship and correlations with one another. The plot
highlights how the 2SFCA and B2SFCA methods are fundamentally similar in
the ways in which they allocate demand to the clinics with only a few
clinics above or below the scatterplot trend line. Likewise, it is
interesting to note the relatively high correlations between the PPRs at
the clinics in the FCA methods and the capacity-to-demand ratios ratios
in the MNL model with the scatterplot revealing some non-linearity in
this relationship across the methods.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./img/pair_plot_ppr} \caption{\label{fig:ppr_dist}Comparing Accessibility Distributions}\label{fig:ppr_dist_fig}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:los_maps} displays the levels of service for the clinic
locations. In general, more urban clinics tend to exhibit higher levels
of demand and lower levels of service across all three models. However,
the PPR values for the individual clinics in the 2SFCA are extremely
small compared to results from the B2SFCA model, highlighting how the
original method's multiple counting tends to inflate the (travel time
weighted) population numbers in each clinic's catchment and deflate the
level of service available at the clinics. In contrast, the PPRs in the
B2SFCA method are readily interpretable as the local ratio of doctors
per person for a given clinic considering the (travel-time weighted and
apportioned) populations within its catchment. Similarly, the MNL CDRs
reflect the relationship between the trip demand and patient capacity
based on the assumed rates. In terms of spatial trends, results from the
2SFCA and MNL models suggest both calculate higher levels of service at
larger clinics in the urban core as well as at a larger clinic in the
city's rural north-west. In contrast, the B2SFCA method generally
produces higher levels of service in an east-to-west direction. This
could reflect boundary effects in the study area that omit the large
populations present in the rest of the Greater Toronto Area on the
northern side of Lake Ontario that may also have access to these clinics
by driving.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./img/los_maps} \caption{\label{fig:los_maps}Comparing Accessibility Distributions}\label{fig:los_maps_fig}
\end{figure}

\hypertarget{healthcare-accessibility}{%
\subsection{Healthcare Accessibility}\label{healthcare-accessibility}}

With the levels of service calculated above, the three models then
calculate accessibility to healthcare services in Hamilton.
Distributions, relationships, and correlations for the accessibility
results are shown in Figure \ref{fig:access_dist}. In this case, all
three models are highly correlated. The 2SFCA and B2SFCA produce nearly
identical distributions of results, although in the case of the balanced
method, the accessibilities correspond to the sum of travel time
weighted and apportioned provider-to-population ratios available in the
population zones free of the inflation and deflation that occurs in the
2SFCA. In contrast, the scatterplots of the MNL results again highlight
some non-linearity in the way the utility-based accessibilities are
calculated compared to the FCA methods. The thinner tail of the MNL
distribution suggests the method also results in fewer population zones
with lower accessibility compared to the FCA methods.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./img/pair_plot_access} \caption{\label{fig:access_dist}Comparing Accessibility Distributions}\label{fig:access_dist_fig}
\end{figure}

The general spatial trends are similar across all three models (Figure
\ref{fig:access_maps}). The absolute accessibility values differ in
accordance with the ways each method calculates its accessibility
results. The FCA methods define accessibility based on the
physician-to-population ratios of clinics, resulting in smaller values.
In contrast, the MNL method defines accessibilities as the logsum of the
multinomial logit model, resulting in larger values that have no direct
interpretation. In general, the highest accessibilities to primary care
physicians correspond to the downtown area of Hamilton, where a large
number of clinics are concentrated. Accessibility to physicians
generally decreases with increased distance from the downtown area.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./img/access_maps} \caption{\label{fig:access_maps}Accessibility Results}\label{fig:plot access_maps}
\end{figure}

To better highlight significant differences in the spatial patterns of
accessibility produced by each method, Figure \ref{fig:access_diff_maps}
displays the absolute differences in the normalized accessibilities
across models. To make the values comparable, we first normalize each
accessibility vector between 0-1 and take the differences of the
normalized values across each approach. In general, the MNL method tends
to produce higher accessibilities for most zones compared to the FCA
methods. In line with the distributions above, the 2SFCA and B2SFCA
models appear to be most similar, with only slight absolute differences
in the calculated accessibility values.

\begin{figure}
\includegraphics[width=1\linewidth]{./img/access_diff_maps} \caption{\label{fig:access_diff_maps}Accessibility Differences}\label{fig:plot access_diff_maps}
\end{figure}

To examine whether there are any spatial patterns in these differences,
Figure \ref{fig:access_locm_maps} plots the results of Local Moran's I
tests. The Local Moran's I is calculated on the differences using
queen-style contiguity weights, a critical significance level of
\(p=0.05\), and without correcting for multiple testing. The resulting
maps reveal some interesting patterns of spatial clustering in the
calculated normalized differences, particularly across the two FCA
models compared to the MNL model. Here, differences in accessibility are
greatest between the FCA and MNL methods in the low-low (LL) cluster in
the ring of outer suburbs that surround the city. In contrast, the
calculated accessibilities are more consistent across the methods in the
high-high (HH) cluster in the central part of the city. Differences in
the remaining zones are not significant (NS).

This overall pattern is likely due to the way the MNL approach handles
clinic choices with populations tending to select their nearest clinics.
On the one hand, the greater accessibilities in more suburban and rural
zones likely derived from these populations accessing their closest
facility. On the other hand, this also means that fewer individuals from
more urban locations are competing for healthcare resources in these
more suburban and rural areas, leading to higher levels of service at
these suburban and rural clinics. In contrast, the FCA methods allocate
populations to all clinics within their catchment area using weights
derived from the impedance function. While this produces a smoothing of
the accessibilities, it can result in lower levels of service and
accessibility for clinics that populations may not actually use. This
effect seems to be minimized in more urban locations featuring higher
population densities and a greater number of clinics with available
physicians. Comparing the normalized results from the 2SFCA and the
B2SFCA models, the patterns of spatial clustering in the differences
appears to be less associated with the city's urban-suburban-rural urban
structure. While the B2SFCA method generally calculates slightly higher
accessibilities across the western half of the city, the methods are
most dissimilar in the south-east rural area.

\hypertarget{discussion-and-conclusions}{%
\section{Discussion and Conclusions}\label{discussion-and-conclusions}}

Since the 2SFCA was proposed by Luo and Wang (5), the floating catchment
area approach has been a popular one for calculating place-based
accessibility to healthcare services that considers both the supply and
demand components and several key innovations have been made to FCA
methods since. However, FCA methods are still limited in two important
ways. First, FCA methods do not fully consider aspects of travel and
choicemaking behaviour. Like many of the other place-based accessibility
measures, the only behavioural component of FCA methods is the impedance
function that is used to weight the value of opportunities by the
distance or travel time required to reach them. Second, FCA approaches
also tend to assign population demand and levels-of-service to
facilities or population zones in an overlapping manner, using the
impedance function (and other adjustments) to weight each value within a
catchment area. Crucially, this use of overlapping catchment areas in
prevous FCA approaches has been shown to bias results by
inflating/deflating supply and demand. While the B2SFCA proposed by Páez
et al. (9) rectifies this, it does so by apportioning fractions of
populations and levels-of-service through adjustments to the impedance
function.

To respond to these issues, this research developed a multinomial logit
destination choice model for calculating utility-based transportation
accessibility to primary care physicians. While FCA approaches consider
accessibility in terms of provider-to-population ratios weighted by
distance or travel time, the MNL approach reframes the measurement of
health accessibility into individual trips to visit primary care
physicians and the utility-bearing aspects of clinics. With its basis in
random utility theory, the MNL model considers several additional
aspects that define the appeal of clinics in addition to the travel time
required to reach them, including the number of physicians available at
the clinic and the level of crowding. The destination choice model also
avoids multiple-counting as the iterative fitting procedure results in
the assignment of each patient trip to a single clinic on average.

Comparisons of the MNL approach with 2SFCA and B2SFCA models using data
for the City of Hamilton suggests that the accessibility patterns
produced by each method are broadly similar, with the highest
accessibilities in the central core of the city where many clinics and
physicians are located. However, further analysis of the distributions,
correlations, and spatial clustering of accessibility differences
reveals that the MNL method produces generally higher accessibilities
throughout much of Hamilton with the greatest differences seen in the
ring of suburban and rural zones that surround the city. It seems likely
that these results arise from the MNL model assigning trips based on the
most proximate clinic for these residents while more urban residents are
being drawn to more urban clinics. In contrast, the FCA approaches
assign population values to all clinics within their catchment area and
all population zones share the levels-of-service of accessible clinics,
likely leading to higher demand and lower available supply at these
rural and suburban clinics.

For planning and policy, our analysis suggests that both the B2SFCA and
MNL approaches offer merit. While the 2SFCA is generally straightforward
to calculate with limited data requirements, it has been shown to return
biased results as a consequence of double counting that makes the
interpretation of provider-to-population ratios and accessibility scores
problematic. The B2SFCA, on the other hand, requires the same data as
the 2SFCA method but improves on it by preserving the population being
serviced and the level of service. Both the levels-of-service and
accessibilities calculated in the B2SFCA method are readily
interpretable as population-to-provider ratios. However, the only travel
behaviour component in both the 2SFCA and B2SFCA approaches is the
impedance function. While it does tend to result in the greatest weight
placed on the nearest locations in practice, it still results in a
spreading or smoothing of demand and supply. In contrast, the MNL
model's utility-based approach has a stronger behavioral foundation and
considers more aspects that define the appeal of particular clinics. It
also appears to produce what are arguably more realistic results in
suburban and rural areas. However, the MNL approach is more data-hungry
and required several parameter assumptions to be made on the part of the
research team. Moreover, the accessibility scores have no direct
healthcare interpretation.

All methods in our comparative study are limited due to the imposition
of boundary effects that likely over-estimate levels-of-service at the
edges of the city and the consideration of only car travel. Further
research should also be taken to ascertain the sensitivity of the MNL
model results to the parameter assumptions. Moreover, we only focus on
the spatial component of accessibility and do not consider the aspatial
components that also play a significant role in defining an individual's
potential to reach and utilize healthcare services (2). In this regard,
future research should utilize the B2SFCA and MNL approaches for welfare
analysis to measure place- and utility-based accessibility to primary
healthcare services for different socioeconomic, demographic, and
mobility profiles.
